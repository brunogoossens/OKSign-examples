# OKS!Sign examples

This repository contains PHP and NodeJS examples for the API of [OKSign.be](www.oksing.be). The examples are based on the documentation found on [www.oksign.be/public/api]().

## Create account
If you don't have one yet, start by creating an account on [OKSign.be](www.oksing.be).

## Create Organisational token
After successfully creating the account, select the "REST API" button in the main navigation. Fill in the form to add an Organisational token. After submitting the form, you will receive the "x-oksign-authorization" header value. You need this value to make the examples work.
