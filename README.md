# OK!Sign examples

This repository contains PHP and NodeJS examples for the API of [OKSign.be](www.oksing.be). The examples are based on the documentation found on [www.oksign.be/public/api]().

## Quick start
If you don't have an account yet, start by creating it on [OKSign.be](www.oksing.be).

After successfully creating the account, select the "REST API" button in the main navigation. Fill in the form to add an Organisational token. After submitting the form, you will receive the "x-oksign-authorization" header value. You need this value to make the examples work.
